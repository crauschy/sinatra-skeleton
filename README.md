# Sinatra Skeleton

## Summary

This is a skeleton for a **Sinatra+ActiveRecord+Javascript** MVC app.


### Credit and Resources

* This skeleton was adapted from a [Dev Bootcamp](https://devbootcamp.com/) assignment.
* [jQuery AJAX](http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/)
* [Sinatra Docs](http://sinatrarb.com/documentation.html)

### A Note

I stripped down the DBC assignment to its most general components in order to create a good spring board for any future Sinatra app creations. Explanatory Comments (as of now) were put there by DBC.

I will update this skeleton as I see fit. If you have any suggestions, do share!
